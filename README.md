# About This Fork of PTP Trace

This is a development fork of holoplot/ptp-trace to work on some advanced features needed in my environments that may or may not be accepted back upstream.  

## Features to Implement

- Creating of pseudo-timeTransmitter devices for missing referenced source clocks.
- Scopes, to address segementation of network clocks
- Devices, such as boundary or transparent clocks, that can have 0..n timeReceivers and 0..n timeTransmitters
- BPF as source devices for lower level filtering and more accurate packet timestamps.
- PTPv1
- Identification of boundary clocks with proper traceability to PTT/GM clock.
- PTPv2 management messages & stats
- Device identification beyond OUI, using mDNS and known device identification methods
- Descriptive information with backing store for Devices, VLAN's, Scopes.  Seperate per environment
- Anomaly detection and logging
- UI views, expand to Scopes and Devices
- Logging of network events
- Topology visualizations (scope, device, clock)
- REST API for underlying data / events / settings to support a graphical UI
- PCAP logging of all messages with log rotation
- Embedded CLI to manage settings, actions, etc.

## Items to review / address

- Internal use of BCMA to calculate PTT/Grandmaster has no awareness of clock scope/heirarchy, only Domain, and ignores steps removed.
- Need to review message ingest rate, which is currently limited to 100 per interval (default: 1s), which is well below the generation rate for a large network.  Compounded by a pause causing messages to back up.
- VLAN support for untagged VLAN's
- Buffer limits on raw buffer ingest
- Gracefully handle network interfaces disapearing / reappearing
- Mouse movement causing full refresh / not scoped in modals

## 📄 PCAP File Analysis

PTP Trace supports offline analysis of PTP traffic from pcap files in offline mode.

### Creating PCAP Files:
```bash
# Capture PTP traffic with tcpdump (Linux/macOS)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w ptp_capture.pcap 'udp port 319 or udp port 320 or ether proto 0x88f7'

# Capture with Wireshark (all platforms)
# Filter: udp.port == 319 or udp.port == 320 or eth.type == 0x88f7
# Save as: ptp_capture.pcap

# Analyze the captured file
./target/release/ptp-trace --pcap-file ptp_capture.pcap
```

## ✊ Terminology & Inclusive Language

In accordance with [IEEE 1588g-2022](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1588g/10478/), this project uses **inclusive terminology** to describe the roles of network components.

### 🔄 **Term Mapping**

| **Inclusive term**                 | **Industry Standard** | **Description**                              |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Time Transmitter**               | Master Clock          | Device that provides timing reference        |
| **Time Receiver**                  | Slave Clock           | Device that synchronizes to timing reference |
| **Primary Time Transmitter (PTT)** | Grandmaster Clock     | Best master clock selected by BMCA algorithm |

The underlying PTP protocol and packet structures remain unchanged - only the user-facing terminology has been modernized for clarity and inclusivity.

A [blog post from Meinberg](https://blog.meinbergglobal.com/2023/02/13/a-step-toward-a-more-inclusive-terminology-for-ptp/) has more information about the topic.

To update the database, follow these steps:

```bash
# Update OUI database
python3 -r oui/requirements.txt
python3 oui/gen_oui_rust_phf.py >src/oui_map.rs

# Make sure to lint the code after updating the database
cargo clippy
```

Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting pull requests with the updated OUI database.
